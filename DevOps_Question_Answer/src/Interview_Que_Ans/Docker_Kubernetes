1.	What is a volume in Docker and how can I attach one in a docker container & K8?

1. What is a Volume in Docker?
In Docker, a volume is a special storage mechanism that lives outside the container‚Äôs writable layer.
It‚Äôs designed for persistent data that should survive container restarts, deletions, or upgrades.
Key points to mention in an interview:
Volumes are stored in Docker‚Äôs storage area (usually /var/lib/docker/volumes) unless you mount them elsewhere.
Unlike container layers, volumes are not deleted when you remove a container (unless explicitly removed).
Volumes are the preferred way to store and share data between containers.
They avoid performance issues of bind mounts and are more portable.

Types of Storage in Docker
Bind mounts ‚Äì Map a host machine path to a container path.
Volumes ‚Äì Managed by Docker, stored in a Docker-controlled location.
tmpfs mounts ‚Äì Store data in memory only.

2. Attaching a Volume in Docker
You can attach a volume when running a container using the -v or --mount flag.
Example:
bash
Copy
Edit
# Create a named volume
docker volume create mydata

# Run a container and attach the volume
docker run -d \
  --name mycontainer \
  -v mydata:/app/data \
  nginx
What happens here:
mydata is created if it doesn‚Äôt exist.
/app/data inside the container is linked to that volume.
Data persists even if the container is removed.
With --mount syntax (clearer for production use):
bash
Copy
Edit
docker run -d \
  --name mycontainer \
  --mount source=mydata,target=/app/data \
  nginx
3. Attaching a Volume in Kubernetes (K8s)
In K8s, "volumes" work differently from Docker ‚Äî they are tied to a Pod‚Äôs lifecycle (but can point to persistent storage).
For data that survives pod restarts, you use a PersistentVolume (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC).
Example: Using an emptyDir volume (ephemeral):
yaml
Copy
Edit
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myapp
      image: nginx
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /app/data
          name: my-volume
  volumes:
    - name: my-volume
      emptyDir: {}
This is ephemeral (deleted when the pod dies).

Example: Using a PVC (persistent across pod restarts):
yaml
Copy
Edit
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mypvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myapp
      image: nginx
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /app/data
          name: my-volume
  volumes:
    - name: my-volume
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: mypvc
In Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):
The PV can be backed by Azure Disk or Azure File for persistent cloud storage.

4. How to Answer in an Azure DevOps Interview
If asked:
"What is a volume and how do you attach one in Docker & Kubernetes?"
You might say:
"In Docker, a volume is a way to store data outside the container‚Äôs writable layer so it persists beyond the container‚Äôs lifecycle.
It‚Äôs managed by Docker and can be attached at container creation using the -v or --mount option. For example: docker run -v mydata:/app/data nginx.
In Kubernetes, volumes are defined in Pod specs, but for persistence beyond the pod‚Äôs life, we use PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims, which in Azure can be backed by Azure Disks or Azure Files.
The PVC is then mounted into the pod using volumeMounts in the YAML."

2.	How to create a volume in Docker & K8?

1. Creating a Volume in Docker
What a volume is:
A volume is persistent storage managed by Docker, separate from the container‚Äôs writable layer. This lets data persist even if the container is deleted.
Steps:
A) Create a named volume
bash
Copy
Edit
docker volume create myvolume

B) Use it in a container
bash
Copy
Edit
docker run -d \
  --name mycontainer \
  -v myvolume:/data \
  nginx
Here:
myvolume is the Docker-managed storage.
/data is the path inside the container.

C) Inspect the volume
bash
Copy
Edit
docker volume inspect myvolume

2. Creating a Volume in Kubernetes
In Kubernetes, ‚Äúvolumes‚Äù are defined in the pod‚Äôs YAML.
Persistent storage is usually handled with PersistentVolume (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC).

A) Static provisioning example
Define PersistentVolume (PV)
yaml
Copy
Edit
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv-example
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: /mnt/data
Define PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)
yaml
Copy
Edit
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: pvc-example
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
Use PVC in a Pod
yaml
Copy
Edit
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: mycontainer
      image: nginx
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /data
          name: my-storage
  volumes:
    - name: my-storage
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: pvc-example
Azure DevOps context
If they specifically mean Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):

The PV will often use an Azure Disk or Azure File backend.
You can define storageClassName in the PVC to provision storage dynamically:
yaml
Copy
Edit
spec:
  storageClassName: azurefile
or
yaml
Copy
Edit
spec:
  storageClassName: managed-premium

3.	What is namespace in K8?

In Kubernetes (K8s), a namespace is a logical partition within a Kubernetes cluster that allows you to organize and manage resources in a way that keeps them separate from other groups of resources.
Here‚Äôs a breakdown ‚Äî framed in an Azure DevOps interview-friendly way:

Definition
A namespace in Kubernetes is like a "virtual cluster" inside the physical cluster.
It provides a scope for names of resources so that two teams (or projects) can have resources with the same name without conflict.

Key Points to Mention in an Interview
Purpose
Helps in multi-tenancy: different teams or environments (dev, test, prod) can share the same cluster without interfering with each other.
Enables resource isolation: CPU, memory, and storage quotas can be enforced per namespace.
Scope
Namespaces are for namescoped resources (Pods, Services, Deployments, etc.).
Some resources (like Nodes, PersistentVolumes) are cluster-scoped and don‚Äôt belong to any namespace.
Default behavior
If you don‚Äôt specify a namespace, Kubernetes uses the default namespace.
Kubernetes comes with predefined namespaces:
default ‚Üí for resources without a specified namespace
kube-system ‚Üí for system components
kube-public ‚Üí publicly readable resources
kube-node-lease ‚Üí for node heartbeat leases
Azure DevOps Context
In Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), namespaces are useful when Azure DevOps pipelines deploy apps for multiple environments to the same AKS cluster.
For example:
dev namespace ‚Üí deployments from development branch
qa namespace ‚Üí deployments for QA testing
prod namespace ‚Üí production workloads
You can apply Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to namespaces so different Azure DevOps service connections have least privilege.
Command Examples
bash
Copy
Edit
# Create a namespace
kubectl create namespace dev

# List namespaces
kubectl get namespaces

# Deploy to a specific namespace
kubectl apply -f app.yaml -n dev
üí° Interview Tip:
If they push deeper, mention that namespaces are not for security boundaries in the strictest sense‚Äînetwork policies and RBAC must be combined to secure workloads between namespaces.

4.	How can I create a new node in K8 via command?

In Kubernetes (K8s), you don‚Äôt literally ‚Äúcreate‚Äù a node by running a kubectl command, because a node is an actual machine (physical or virtual) that joins the cluster.
Instead, the process usually depends on where the cluster is running.
Since you mentioned Azure DevOps, I‚Äôll assume the cluster is in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), but I‚Äôll cover the general idea first.

General Kubernetes Concept
A node is added to the cluster by provisioning a VM (or server) and then running kubeadm join with the token from the control plane (for self-managed clusters).
You cannot run something like kubectl create node to add a working node ‚Äî that only creates an object in etcd, but it won‚Äôt actually run workloads.
For AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)
In AKS, nodes are managed via node pools.
To add a new node in AKS, you scale the node pool.
Command:
bash
Copy
Edit
# Add 1 more node to a node pool
az aks scale \
  --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> \
  --name <AKSClusterName> \
  --node-count <NumberOfNodes> \
  --nodepool-name <NodePoolName>
Example:
bash
Copy
Edit
az aks scale \
  --resource-group MyResourceGroup \
  --name MyAKSCluster \
  --node-count 4 \
  --nodepool-name nodepool1
This will create new VM(s) and join them to your cluster automatically.
For Self-Managed Kubernetes
If you‚Äôre setting up your own cluster (not AKS, EKS, GKE):

Provision a new VM or server with Kubernetes installed.
On the new node, run:
bash
Copy
Edit
kubeadm join <control-plane-endpoint>:6443 \
  --token <token> \
  --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<hash>
Verify:
bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl get nodes
üí° Interview Tip:
If they ask this in an Azure DevOps interview, they probably expect:
For AKS ‚Üí use az aks scale or create a new node pool with az aks nodepool add.
Mention that in vanilla Kubernetes, nodes join via kubeadm join, not kubectl create.

5.	What are the contents of a Dockerfile?

In an Azure DevOps interview, when asked "What are the contents of a Dockerfile?", the goal is to show that you understand both the purpose of a Dockerfile and the typical instructions it contains.
Here‚Äôs a clear, structured answer you could give:

1. Purpose of a Dockerfile
A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. It defines:
The base image
Application source code
Dependencies
Build steps
Runtime configuration

2. Common Contents of a Dockerfile
Typical instructions include:
Base image ‚Äì specifies the starting point
dockerfile
Copy
Edit
FROM ubuntu:20.04
or

dockerfile
Copy
Edit
FROM node:18-alpine
Metadata ‚Äì provides information about the image

dockerfile
Copy
Edit
LABEL maintainer="devops@example.com"
Environment variables ‚Äì set variables for the container

dockerfile
Copy
Edit
ENV APP_ENV=production
Working directory ‚Äì sets the default directory inside the container

dockerfile
Copy
Edit
WORKDIR /app
Copy files into the image ‚Äì adds source code/configuration

dockerfile
Copy
Edit
COPY . /app
Install dependencies ‚Äì runs commands during build

dockerfile
Copy
Edit
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3
Expose ports ‚Äì informs which ports the container listens on

dockerfile
Copy
Edit
EXPOSE 8080
Default command ‚Äì specifies what runs when the container starts

dockerfile
Copy
Edit
CMD ["python3", "app.py"]
or

dockerfile
Copy
Edit
ENTRYPOINT ["./start.sh"]
3. Azure DevOps Angle
In Azure DevOps, the Dockerfile:

Is stored in the repository along with the app code.
Is referenced in a CI/CD pipeline (usually in a YAML file) for automated image builds.
Can be optimized for smaller size and faster builds, which is important in cloud deployments.

‚úÖ Sample Summary Answer for Interview:
A Dockerfile is a script of instructions for building a Docker image. It typically contains:
A FROM statement to specify the base image.
Optional LABEL for metadata.
ENV for environment variables.
WORKDIR to set the working directory.
COPY or ADD to include application files.
RUN to install dependencies or perform build steps.
EXPOSE to specify listening ports.
CMD or ENTRYPOINT to define the default execution command.
In Azure DevOps, the Dockerfile is used in build pipelines to produce container images that can be pushed to registries like Azure Container Registry and deployed to AKS or App Services.

6.	Dockerfile vs Docker compose

In an Azure DevOps interview, if they ask ‚ÄúDockerfile vs Docker Compose?‚Äù, they‚Äôre testing whether you understand the distinction between image creation and multi-container orchestration‚Äîand how these tools fit into CI/CD pipelines.
Here‚Äôs a clear breakdown you could use in your answer:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Dockerfile
Purpose ‚Üí Defines how to build a Docker image (instructions to package your app with dependencies).
Format ‚Üí A plain text file with instructions (FROM, COPY, RUN, EXPOSE, etc.).
Scope ‚Üí Focuses on one image.
Usage in Azure DevOps ‚Üí
Used in pipeline build stage to create an image (docker build -t myimage .).
Often stored in the repo alongside the application code.
Example:
dockerfile
Copy
Edit
FROM node:18
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
Analogy ‚Üí Like a recipe for baking one cake.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Docker Compose
Purpose ‚Üí Defines & runs multi-container applications (services, networks, volumes).
Format ‚Üí YAML file describing how containers interact.
Scope ‚Üí Orchestrates multiple containers together.
Usage in Azure DevOps ‚Üí
Used in pipeline deploy/test stages to spin up local/test environments quickly (docker-compose up).
Handy for integration tests (e.g., app container + database + cache).
Example:
yaml
Copy
Edit
version: "3"
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
  db:
    image: postgres:14
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example
Analogy ‚Üí Like a party planner who coordinates the cake, drinks, music, and decorations together.

Key Differences Table
Feature	Dockerfile	Docker Compose
Function	Build an image	Run multi-container apps
File type	Text file with build instructions	YAML file with service definitions
Scope	Single image	Multiple containers + networks/volumes
Command	docker build	docker-compose up
Azure DevOps role	Build stage	Deploy/Test stage

üí° Interview Tip:
You can wrap up by saying:
"In Azure DevOps pipelines, the Dockerfile is used during the build phase to create images, while Docker Compose can be used in integration testing or local deployments to coordinate multiple services.
In production, Compose is often replaced by Kubernetes manifests or Azure Container Apps configurations."

7.	How do you create a Dockerfile for any application deployment?

In an Azure DevOps or cloud deployment interview, when they ask "How do you create a Dockerfile for any application deployment?", they‚Äôre usually testing whether you understand:
The role of Docker in deployment pipelines (including Azure Container Registry, AKS, or App Service).
The general structure of a Dockerfile that can be adapted for any app.
Here‚Äôs how you‚Äôd answer in a structured, interview-friendly way:

1. Explain the Purpose
A Dockerfile is a script of instructions that tells Docker how to build an image containing your application and its dependencies.
In Azure, the image can be pushed to Azure Container Registry (ACR) and then deployed to services like Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), App Service for Containers, or Azure Container Instances.

2. General Steps to Create a Dockerfile (Any Application)
Regardless of language, you typically follow these steps:
Choose a base image
Use a lightweight OS or language runtime image (e.g., python:3.11-alpine, node:20-alpine, mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0).
In Azure, prefer Microsoft-hosted base images from MCR (Microsoft Container Registry) for security and compatibility.
Set working directory
WORKDIR /app to define where inside the container your app lives.
Copy application code
Use .dockerignore to avoid copying unnecessary files.
COPY . .
Install dependencies
Example for Python: RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
Example for Node.js: RUN npm install --only=production
Expose ports
EXPOSE 80 or whichever port your app listens on.
Define start command
CMD ["python", "app.py"] or ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "MyApp.dll"].

3. Example Generic Dockerfile
Here‚Äôs a template for any application:
dockerfile
Copy
Edit
# Step 1: Choose a base image
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0 AS base
WORKDIR /app
# Step 2: Copy project files
COPY . .
# Step 3: Install dependencies (language-specific)
# For .NET example
RUN dotnet restore
RUN dotnet build -c Release --no-restore
# Step 4: Publish application
RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o out
# Step 5: Expose port and set entry point
EXPOSE 80
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "out/MyApp.dll"]
(For Node/Python/Java apps, just swap the base image and dependency commands.)

4. Azure-Specific Best Practices
Use multi-stage builds to keep images small.
Scan images with Microsoft Defender for Cloud before deployment.
Store images in Azure Container Registry (ACR).
Use .dockerignore to reduce build context size.
In Azure Pipelines, add a docker build ‚Üí docker push step before deployment.
If you phrase it like this in an interview, you‚Äôll show you understand both the technical Dockerfile creation process and the Azure deployment context.

8.	Explain k8 architecture.

Alright ‚Äî let‚Äôs break down Kubernetes (k8s) architecture in a way that makes sense for an Azure interview, where they might expect you to connect it with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

1. Kubernetes Architecture Overview
Kubernetes is a container orchestration system with a control plane (brains) and worker nodes (muscle).
In Azure, the control plane is usually managed by AKS (so you don‚Äôt have to manage the master VMs yourself).

A. Control Plane Components
This is where cluster-wide decisions happen (scheduling, scaling, API access).
Component	Purpose
API Server (kube-apiserver)	The front door of Kubernetes ‚Äî all commands (kubectl, dashboard, Azure CLI) go through here.
etcd	A distributed key-value store ‚Äî holds cluster state and config (e.g., which pods exist, which nodes they run on).
Controller Manager (kube-controller-manager)	Runs background controllers (e.g., ReplicaSet Controller, Node Controller) to make sure reality matches the desired state.
Scheduler (kube-scheduler)	Decides which node gets which pod, based on resources, affinity, taints, etc.
Cloud Controller Manager	Connects k8s with cloud APIs (in AKS, this talks to Azure for load balancers, storage, etc.).
In AKS:
Azure manages the control plane for you (no SSH into masters).
SLA-backed API server and etcd hosted in Azure.

B. Worker Node Components
These are VMs (nodes) where workloads (Pods) actually run.

Component	Purpose
kubelet	Talks to the API server, ensures containers are running as specified in Pod specs.
kube-proxy	Handles networking and load balancing inside the cluster.
Container Runtime	Runs the containers (Docker, containerd, etc.).
In AKS, worker nodes run inside a node pool (Azure VMs).

C. Pods, Deployments, and Services
Pod: Smallest deployable unit ‚Äî wraps one or more containers.
Deployment: Defines desired pod replicas and handles rolling updates.
Service: Stable networking endpoint for pods.

2. Azure-Specific Additions in AKS
When explaining in an Azure interview, link architecture to Azure-managed services:
Azure Load Balancer / Application Gateway ‚Üí Integrates with k8s Services of type LoadBalancer.
Azure Disk & Azure Files ‚Üí Persistent Volumes.
Azure Monitor + Container Insights ‚Üí Observability.
Azure AD integration ‚Üí RBAC and identity-based access to the API server.
Virtual Network (VNet) Integration ‚Üí CNI-based pod networking.

‚úÖ Pro tip for interviews: If they specifically ask about AKS, emphasize:
Managed control plane ‚Üí You only manage nodes, not masters.
Azure integrations ‚Üí Networking, load balancing, storage, monitoring.
Security & scaling ‚Üí Role-based access (RBAC), horizontal/vertical scaling.

9.	Difference between k8 deployment and stateful set.

In Kubernetes (including when running in Azure Kubernetes Service), the difference between a Deployment and a StatefulSet mostly comes down to how they manage pod identity, storage, and scaling behavior.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown you could give in an interview:

1. Deployment
Purpose: For stateless workloads.
Pod identity: Pods are interchangeable ‚Äî no stable network identity. Each pod gets a random name (e.g., app-5d9d8b4c78-xyz12).
Scaling: You can scale up/down easily; new pods don‚Äôt have to keep the same identity or data.
Storage: Usually uses ephemeral storage or shared external volumes; pods do not have dedicated persistent storage.
Use cases: Web servers, API backends, stateless microservices.
In Azure: Often backed by Azure Disks or Azure Files if you need shared storage, but typically stateless containers.

2. StatefulSet
Purpose: For stateful workloads that need stable identity and data persistence.
Pod identity: Each pod has a stable, unique name (e.g., db-0, db-1, db-2).
Scaling: Maintains pod ordering and identity when scaling up or down.
Storage: Each pod can have its own PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC), usually bound to a PersistentVolume (e.g., Azure Managed Disk) ‚Äî data persists even if the pod restarts.
Use cases: Databases (MySQL, MongoDB), Kafka, Redis clusters.
In Azure: Commonly paired with Azure Disks for per-pod persistent storage.

Quick comparison table:
Feature	                    Deployment	        StatefulSet
Workload type	            Stateless	        Stateful
Pod identity	            Random	            Stable
Pod ordering	            No	                Yes
Storage	                    Shared/ephemeral	Dedicated PVC per pod
Scaling behavior	        Any order	        Ordered (scale up/down carefully)
Azure example usage	        Frontend app	    SQL Server on Linux

üí° Interview tip:
If they ask specifically for Azure context, mention that:
Both can be used in AKS.
StatefulSet often works with Azure Disks for durable per-pod storage.
Deployment pods can use Azure Files if shared storage is needed.

10.	Difference between k8 deployment and replica set. How do different deployments work?

Got it ‚Äî you‚Äôre asking about the difference between Kubernetes (k8s) Deployment and ReplicaSet, plus how different types of Deployments work (in the context of Azure Kubernetes Service, AKS).
Here‚Äôs the breakdown:

1. Deployment vs ReplicaSet in Kubernetes
Feature	ReplicaSet	Deployment
Purpose	Ensures a specified number of identical Pods are running at any given time.	Manages ReplicaSets and provides declarative updates to Pods (versioned rollouts & rollbacks).
Scope	Just maintains Pod count ‚Äî if a Pod dies, it replaces it.	Defines desired state (image, replicas, strategy) and automatically manages ReplicaSets for rollouts.
Version Control	No built-in versioning ‚Äî changing Pod spec replaces Pods abruptly.	Supports rollout history and rollbacks.
Use Case	Usually created indirectly by a Deployment. Rarely used directly unless you need only a static Pod set without rollouts.	Standard way to run stateless apps in production.
Management Level	Lower-level abstraction	Higher-level abstraction
üí° Key Point:
A Deployment automatically creates and manages a ReplicaSet.
You almost never need to manage ReplicaSets manually in production ‚Äî you manage Deployments, which in turn manage ReplicaSets.

2. How Different Deployment Strategies Work
In AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service), Deployments follow Kubernetes core strategies. Common ones:

a) Rolling Update (default)
Updates Pods gradually (one or more at a time) while keeping the service running.
Controlled via:
maxUnavailable (how many Pods can be down at once)
maxSurge (how many extra Pods can be created during update)
Best for: Zero downtime updates in production.
Example:
yaml
Copy
Edit
strategy:
  type: RollingUpdate
  rollingUpdate:
    maxUnavailable: 1
    maxSurge: 1

b) Recreate
Deletes all existing Pods, then creates new ones.
Causes downtime during the deployment.
Best for: When new version is incompatible with old version.
Example:
yaml
Copy
Edit
strategy:
  type: Recreate

c) Blue-Green Deployment (implemented outside native Deployment API, often via service switching)
Run two environments: ‚Äúblue‚Äù (current) and ‚Äúgreen‚Äù (new).
After testing green, switch traffic from blue to green instantly.
In AKS, can be done using:
Multiple Deployments
Service selector switching
Ingress routing

d) Canary Deployment
Gradually send small % of traffic to the new version before full rollout.
Achieved in AKS using:
Multiple Deployments with weighted routing (via Ingress Controller like NGINX or Azure Front Door)
Progressive delivery tools (Argo Rollouts, Flagger)

‚úÖ Interview Tip:
If asked "What‚Äôs the difference between Deployment and ReplicaSet in AKS?", make sure you emphasize:
Deployment manages ReplicaSets.
You use Deployments for rollouts, scaling, and rollback.
ReplicaSets just ensure Pod count, no rollout logic.

11.	What is k8 services and explain its types.

In Kubernetes (often abbreviated k8s), a Service is an abstraction that defines a stable way to access a set of Pods.

Pods in Kubernetes are ephemeral ‚Äî their IP addresses change when they are recreated.
A Service provides a permanent virtual IP (ClusterIP) or DNS name so that applications or external clients can reliably communicate with your workload.
Think of a Service as a ‚Äúnetwork front door‚Äù to your Pods.
Why Services are Needed
Pods come and go ‚Äî Services keep the communication stable.
Load balance traffic between multiple Pods.
Enable communication inside the cluster and outside to the world.
Integrate with DNS (myservice.namespace.svc.cluster.local).

Types of Kubernetes Services
Kubernetes defines 4 main Service types (relevant for Azure DevOps work as well):

1. ClusterIP (Default)
Purpose: Exposes the Service inside the cluster only.
Access: No external access; only reachable from within other Pods/Services.
Use case: Internal microservice communication.
Example: Database service only used by backend pods.
yaml
Copy
Edit
type: ClusterIP

2. NodePort
Purpose: Exposes the Service on a static port on each Node‚Äôs IP.
Access: Can be accessed from outside using <NodeIP>:<NodePort>.
Use case: Quick external access for testing without a load balancer.
Notes: Limited to port range 30000‚Äì32767 by default.
yaml
Copy
Edit
type: NodePort

3. LoadBalancer
Purpose: Provisions an external load balancer from the cloud provider (Azure, AWS, etc.).
Access: Gets an external IP; routes traffic to NodePort/ClusterIP behind the scenes.
Use case: Production-grade public services (e.g., web apps).
In Azure: Creates an Azure Load Balancer automatically.
yaml
Copy
Edit
type: LoadBalancer

4. ExternalName
Purpose: Maps a Service to an external DNS name instead of selecting Pods.
Access: Acts like a CNAME DNS record.
Use case: Accessing an external service as if it were inside the cluster.
Example: Using my-db-service to point to database.company.com.
yaml
Copy
Edit
type: ExternalName

‚úÖ Tip for Azure DevOps interviews:
Be ready to explain how these integrate with AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service).
For example, LoadBalancer in AKS creates an Azure Load Balancer, and Azure DNS can handle the service name.
Also, mention that you can expose applications securely using Ingress + ClusterIP instead of directly using LoadBalancer.

12.	What is PVC (Persistent Volume Claim)?

In the context of Azure DevOps interviews ‚Äî especially if the question comes up while discussing Kubernetes (like AKS) ‚Äî a PVC (Persistent Volume Claim) is a Kubernetes resource that allows pods to request.
Use persistent storage without having to know the underlying storage details.
Here‚Äôs a clear breakdown:

Definition
PVC (Persistent Volume Claim) is a request for storage by a Kubernetes pod.
It is how pods "claim" the use of a Persistent Volume (PV), which represents actual storage (e.g., Azure Disk, Azure Files, NFS).
Think of it like ordering food in a restaurant:
PV = the kitchen‚Äôs available ingredients (storage capacity already provisioned).
PVC = your order specifying how much and what type of food you want (storage request).
How it works in AKS / Azure context
Pod needs storage (e.g., for logs, database files).
PVC is created specifying:
Size (e.g., 10Gi)
Access mode (ReadWriteOnce, ReadOnlyMany, ReadWriteMany)
Storage class (e.g., managed-premium for Azure Disk)
Kubernetes finds a matching PV (or provisions one dynamically if a StorageClass is used).
The PVC is bound to that PV.
The Pod mounts the PVC and uses it just like a normal filesystem.
Why it‚Äôs important for Azure DevOps
When deploying workloads (like databases, apps with state) on AKS, you need persistent storage that survives pod restarts or rescheduling.
Azure DevOps pipelines often deploy these workloads with Helm charts or YAML manifests that include PVC definitions.
Using PVCs allows you to abstract away the storage details ‚Äî developers don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs Azure Disk or Azure File; they just specify requirements.
Key points to mention in an interview
PVC is a request for persistent storage in Kubernetes.
Decouples pod storage requests from the actual storage implementation.
Works with StorageClass for dynamic provisioning in AKS (e.g., managed-premium, azurefile).
Important for stateful applications in CI/CD pipelines.

13.	What is ingress? Ingress vs Load Balancer.

Let‚Äôs break this down so it‚Äôs crystal clear ‚Äî both from a cloud perspective and an Azure DevOps interview perspective.

1. What is Ingress?
In Kubernetes (and Azure Kubernetes Service ‚Äî AKS), an Ingress is:
A Kubernetes API object that manages external access to services in a cluster, typically HTTP/HTTPS.
It acts like a smart router ‚Äî you can define rules for routing traffic to different services based on the request host or path.
Ingress does not itself handle traffic; it needs an Ingress Controller (like NGINX Ingress Controller or Azure Application Gateway Ingress Controller) to actually process and forward the traffic.
Example use case:
You have multiple microservices (/orders, /users, /products) running in AKS. You don‚Äôt want a separate public IP for each. Instead, an Ingress lets you use one IP or domain and route paths to the right services.

2. What is a Load Balancer?
In Azure + Kubernetes context, a Load Balancer:
Distributes incoming traffic across multiple backend instances.
Operates at Layer 4 (TCP/UDP) in the OSI model.
In AKS, a Service of type LoadBalancer will automatically provision an Azure Load Balancer that exposes your app to the internet.
It does not provide path-based routing or SSL termination logic (unless combined with an Application Gateway).
Example use case:
You have a single microservice that needs to be accessed externally. You can expose it via a Load Balancer IP that distributes traffic across all service pods.

3. Key Differences: Ingress vs Load Balancer
Feature	                            Ingress	                                              Load Balancer
Purpose	          Smart routing for HTTP/HTTPS traffic into the cluster	    Distributes network traffic across backend instances
OSI Layer	                    Layer 7 (Application)	                                Layer 4 (Transport)
Traffic Type	                Primarily HTTP/HTTPS	                                Any TCP/UDP traffic
Routing	          Path-based (/app1, /app2) or host-based (app1.example.com)	No path/host routing ‚Äî just forwards traffic
IP Address	                   One IP for multiple services	                            Usually one IP per service
Extra Features	               SSL termination, rewrite rules, virtual hosting	        Basic load balancing
Requires	                    Ingress Controller	                                Backend endpoints (VMs, Pods, etc.)

4. Azure DevOps Interview Angle
If they ask in an Azure DevOps interview, they might expect you to relate it to AKS and CI/CD:
Ingress:
You‚Äôd use this when deploying multiple microservices and want to route traffic using a single endpoint, often defined in YAML manifests and deployed via a pipeline.
Load Balancer:
You might use this for simpler deployments or non-HTTP workloads, also defined in Kubernetes manifests or Terraform, provisioned automatically by AKS.

‚úÖ Summary Soundbite for Interview:
"In AKS, a Load Balancer operates at Layer 4 and simply distributes TCP/UDP traffic to your pods, while Ingress operates at Layer 7 and allows HTTP/HTTPS routing rules, SSL termination, and multiple services behind one IP.
Ingress needs an Ingress Controller, whereas a LoadBalancer-type service provisions an Azure Load Balancer directly."

14.	What is liveness and readiness probes in k8?

In Kubernetes (K8s), liveness and readiness probes are health checks that help Kubernetes decide when to restart containers or when to send traffic to them.
For an Azure DevOps interview, you‚Äôd want to explain both conceptually and practically, since DevOps engineers often work with YAML deployments and AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service).

1. Liveness Probe
Purpose: Checks if the container is still running correctly.
If it fails: Kubernetes restarts the container.
Use case: Detect deadlocks, stuck processes, or app crashes where the container is running but the app is unresponsive.
Example:
yaml
Copy
Edit
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 5

2. Readiness Probe
Purpose: Checks if the container is ready to serve requests.
If it fails: Kubernetes removes the pod from the Service‚Äôs endpoints (no traffic sent), but does not restart the container.
Use case: Wait until app initialization is complete, DB connections are ready, caches are loaded, etc.
Example:
yaml
Copy
Edit
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /ready
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 3

Key Differences
Feature	Liveness Probe	Readiness Probe
Checks	Is the container alive?	Is the container ready to handle requests?
Failure Action	Restart container	Remove from service endpoints
When Used	Detect runtime failures	Delay traffic until startup completed or temporarily stop traffic

In Azure DevOps / AKS Context
When deploying to Azure Kubernetes Service via Azure DevOps pipelines, you might include these probes in your Helm charts or YAML manifests.
They‚Äôre crucial for zero-downtime deployments and self-healing in microservices.

üí° Interview Tip: If they ask for a real-world example, you can say:
‚ÄúIn AKS, we had a microservice that took ~30 seconds to warm up because it had to load large configuration files from Azure Blob Storage.
Without a readiness probe, Kubernetes started routing traffic immediately, causing errors.
Adding a readiness probe ensured the service only started receiving traffic once it was truly ready.‚Äù
